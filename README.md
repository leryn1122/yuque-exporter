## Background

A tiny and tailored Python3 exporter downloads Yuque repo documents in format of markdown through Yuque OpenAPI V2.0,
and archive them to GitHub repo. It was inspired by [M1r0ku/YuqueExport](https://github.com/M1r0ku/YuqueExport).

Now it run as a Kubernetes Cronjob, synchronizing every 8 hours, instead of Linux crontab in early weeks.

## Install

It is written in Python 3.11, and it is available to compile as a binary executable.

- Python 3.11+
- Pipenv
- Git
- PyCharm (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leryn1122/yuque-exporter.git

make install build
```

## Usage

Apply for Yuque token and write your username with token in the config file `~/.yuque/config`.
